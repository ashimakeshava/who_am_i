# WHO AM I?

I'm constantly struggling to define my academic self. As I finish my PhD, I thought I'd find a data-driven way of finding an overview of what topics I find interesting and what I have actually been working on.

On the left, a word cloud of the titles of manuscripts from authors I read regularly. On the right, the titles of the papers I cite in my own work.

This gives me a good totem to meditate on. I'm curious what my word cloud would look in another five years.
